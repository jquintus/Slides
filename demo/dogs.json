But beneath the water is a chaotic ballet of bared teeth and bubbles, paddling paws, fur and ears billowing in the currents. From leaping Lab to diving Dachshund, the water is where a dog's distinct personality shines through; some lounge in the current, paddling slowly, but others arch their bodies to cut through the water with the focus and determination of a shark. In more than eighty portraits, award-winning pet photographer and animal rights activist Seth Casteel captures new sides of our old friends with vibrant underwater photography that makes it impossible to look away. Each image bubbles with exuberance and life, a striking reminder that even in the most loveable and domesticated dog, there are more primal forces at work. In Underwater Dogs, Seth Casteel gives playful and energetic testament to the rough-and-tumble joy that our dogs bring into our lives.", "industryIdentifiers": [ { "type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780316227711" }, { "type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0316227714" } ], "readingModes": { "text": true, "image": false }, "pageCount": 144, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": [ "Photography" ], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.7.7.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": { "containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false }, "imageLinks": { "smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S7XJU5kf6F4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S7XJU5kf6F4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" }, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=S7XJU5kf6F4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=dogs&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S7XJU5kf6F4C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://market.android.com/details?id=book-S7XJU5kf6F4C" }, "saleInfo": { "country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": { "amount": 12.99, "currencyCode": "USD" }, "retailPrice": { "amount": 12.99, "currencyCode": "USD" }, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S7XJU5kf6F4C&rdid=book-S7XJU5kf6F4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [ { "finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": { "amountInMicros": 1.299E7, "currencyCode": "USD" }, "retailPrice": { "amountInMicros": 1.299E7, "currencyCode": "USD" }, "giftable": true } ] }, "accessInfo": { "country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": { "isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Underwater_Dogs-sample-epub.acsm?id=S7XJU5kf6F4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api" }, "pdf": { "isAvailable": false }, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=S7XJU5kf6F4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false }, "searchInfo": { "textSnippet": "In Underwater Dogs, Seth Casteel gives playful and energetic testament to the rough-and-tumble joy that our dogs bring into our lives." } }, { "kind": "books#volume", "id": "0GGyCwAAQBAJ", "etag": "dOwuiC7WM5Q", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0GGyCwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": { "title": "Straw Dogs", "subtitle": "Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals", "authors": [ "John Gray" ], "publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "publishedDate": "2016-03-29", "description": "The British bestseller Straw Dogs is an exciting, radical work of philosophy, which sets out to challenge our most cherished assumptions about what it means to be human. From Plato to Christianity, from the Enlightenment to Nietzsche and Marx, the Western tradition has been based on arrogant and erroneous beliefs about human beings and their place in the world. Philosophies such as liberalism and Marxism think of humankind as a species whose destiny is to transcend natural limits and conquer the Earth. John Gray argues that this belief in human difference is a dangerous illusion and explores how the world and human life look once humanism has been finally abandoned. The result is an exhilarating, sometimes disturbing book that leads the reader to question our deepest-held beliefs. Will Self, in the New Statesman, called Straw Dogs his book of the year: \"I read it once, I read it twice and took notes . . .

She then wondered what had happened to the last litter she'd whelped. It suddenly seemed grossly unfair that one should go through the trouble of having pups only to lose track of them. One summer night in Toronto, Hermes and Apollo make a drunken bet about the possibility of human happiness. And so they grant human consciousness to a group of dogs overnighting at a veterinary clinic. Having suddenly been granted more complex thought, the pack is soon torn between those who resist language, preferring their old \"dog\" ways, and those who embrace it. The gods watch from above as some of the dogs turn violently on one another until only three are left: wily Benjy moves from home to home, intelligent Majnoun finds a surprisingly human relationship with a kind couple, and Prince becomes a poet. For Hermes to win, one of the dogs must be happy at his death. An utterly convincing and moving look at the beauty and perils of consciousness. André Alexis was born in Trinidad and grew up in Canada.

Her narrative gives us insight into the world of dogs in combat and the touching aspect of the relationship between soldiers and their dogs. Frankel explores the long, rich history of dogs in the US military, from the spirit-lifting mascots of the Civil War to the dogs still leading patrols hunting for IEDs today. Frankel not only interviewed handlers who deployed with dogs in wars from Vietnam to Iraq, but top military commanders, K-9 program managers, combat-trained therapists who brought dogs into war zones as part of a preemptive measure to stave off PTSD, and veterinary technicians stationed in Bagram. She makes a passionate case for maintaining a robust war-dog force. In this YA edition, Rebecca Frankel gives further insight into her work as a journalist and how it led her to explore the world of dogs and their handlers.
